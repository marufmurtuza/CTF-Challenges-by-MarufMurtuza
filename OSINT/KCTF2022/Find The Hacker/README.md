<h1>Description:</h1>

The police is looking for a wanted hacker. But you know, it's not that easy to track a hacker.

During an OSINT investigation, from a social media account of that hacker, the police found two photos of the place where the hacker is hiding. But the hacker didn't disclose the place in his post.

By reviewing the hacker's pervious activity, the police though, he is hiding in Thailand. But they were wrong!

Discussing with some experts and travel agency guides, they got to understand that, the place is located somewhere in the north side of Bangladesh. But they can't figure out the exact place.

Can you help the police to find the location?
