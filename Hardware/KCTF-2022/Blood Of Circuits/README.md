Flag: KCTF{BinaryInVein}

Description:

Machines are dumb. Humans need to write set of instructions to make them work smartly!
But as machines are dumb, they don't understand human language. They work on depending on the flow of electricity.
As human body needs to circulate bloods to works, the machines need electricity flow to work.
And we can understand the flow of electricity with the binary representation, where 1 means flow of electricity and 0 means absence of electricity flow.

Flag Example: KCTF{RoseIsRed}



Solve: 

Solvers need to get the output 1 in the logic probe by solving the logic circuit.

The sequence should be like this to get 1 in the logic probe,
1000010 1101001 1101110 1100001 1110010 1111001 1001001 1101110 1010110 1100101 1101001 1101110

Once the logic probe gives the output 1, they will understand that they have solved the circuit.
Now they have to decode the sequence that is given above.
If they decode that with an binary translator, they will get the flag.
