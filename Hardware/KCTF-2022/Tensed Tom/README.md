Description:

Hey hacker,
Yesterday moring, my friend Tom recieved a giftbox in front of our dorm.
The box contains two lcd display, a circuit board and two buttons. The circuit was semi built.
There was a letter inside the box as well.
In the letter, it was written that "I know you are a brilliant boy, Tom. So, here is a puzzle for you. Best of luck!"

So, Tom started to check the circuit. He found that the circuit is misconfigured! So, he configured the circuit properly and found a interesting game in it.
After playing the game for a while, he found a glitch in the game. But later he understood that it was a riddle. 
So he started to solve the riddle, and after solving the riddle, suddenly he got tensed and then he intensionally misconfigured the circuit again and threw it outside the window.
Now, he is behaving weird!
So, now it is very important for us to know what was the thing that made tom so tensed.
Can you please help us?

Regards,
Ned
