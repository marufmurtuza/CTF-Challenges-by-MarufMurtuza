<h1>Solution:</h1>

For solving this challenge, solvers need to write a reverse script according to the encryptor.
After writing the script, they need to brute force the Encrypted texts with the given KEYS in the LETTER.TXT file.
I've provided a sample code for decryptor, you can check that for validating the challenge.
